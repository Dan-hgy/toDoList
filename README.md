# Task Manager Web Application

A simple, client-side web application for managing daily tasks. This project allows users to add, view, complete, delete, filter, and sort their to-do items. It's built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating core web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and client-side storage.

## ✨ Features

* **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks with a description and an optional due date.
* **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of any task.
* **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
* **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`, so they are not lost on page reload.
* **Filter Tasks**: View all tasks, only the active ones, or only the completed ones.
* **Sort by Date**: Organize the task list by the soonest due date.
* **API Integration**: On first load (when no tasks are in storage), the app fetches 5 sample tasks from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
* **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
